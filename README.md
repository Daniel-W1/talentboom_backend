# TalentBoom Backend

TalentBoom Backend is the server-side implementation of the TalentBoom application. It is built using ExpressJS, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js. This repository contains the code responsible for handling API requests, managing databases, and handling authentication.

## Features

- API endpoints for user registration, login, and authentication.
- CRUD operations for managing job postings and learning materials.
- Integration with databases for storing user information, job postings, and learning materials.
- Token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Error handling and validation of incoming requests.

## Technologies Used

- ExpressJS: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of robust and scalable APIs.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data efficiently.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing a straightforward way to work with the database.
- JWT: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and authorization.
- Other dependencies: bcrypt for password hashing, cors for handling cross-origin resource sharing, and more.
